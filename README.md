Game Experience
The Player is a delivery guy for Merkur and you start with your first day. Your job is to deliver the parcels and return to the Merkur station. Your way through the maze of streets should be planned.

Gameplay
Starting the game you have a balance(fuelmoney) and driving around costs you fuelmoney. You start your shift at the Merkur station and you have to get all parcels of the map. Since the map of each day(equivalent to level and shift) is always different, you might be confronted with a new maze. You have to plan your path to deliver the parcels and return to Merkur station. Obstacles on your way are houses, parks, shopping malls and walls. The amount of fuel you use makes the difference.
